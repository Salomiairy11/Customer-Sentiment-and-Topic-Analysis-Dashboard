"This dress is a little big, but it's really cute!"
I ordered a size larger and the fit was not good. The waist is way too high and the sleeves are a snug fit.
Material was all spandex-like. Looks much different in person. Was disappointed in this.
I've gotten so many compliments on this dress. I even walked into a high-end boutique and received compliments on it. Fits perfectly.
I WILL ORDER MORE IN DIFFERENT COLOR!!!
Material is nice. Overall fit is nice and comfy. Only issue is I ordered black and got red.
"The fabric felt cheap and I didn't find it to be a flattering top. For reference, I am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40."
"First of all, this is not pullover styling. There is a side zipper. I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew there was a side zipper."
The tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath. Not at all what it looks like or is described as. Sadly will be returning.
"Love the fit! Soft, yet substantial fabric. Washed nice too. Favorite shirts!"
"Pilled all over after wearing a few times. Cheap, short cotton fibers, disposable, will not reorder. ??"
"These shirts are the best! Good fabric, flattering fit, long enough that I can raise my arms without showing my tummy."
"I love these t-shirts! They're long-waisted, don't rise up, not baggy, thick but super soft and comfy."
Love these shirts! They are great for layering or using alone. I have re-purchased multiple times and have many colors.
After the second wash the material that is around the front neck bunched up. When I looked closer the stitching was uneven at the neckline.
I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. I ordered the petite small but it was outrageously small.
"I reordered it in petite medium. Overall, the top half fit nicely, but the bottom had a very tight under layer and cheap over layers."
A major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper. ?????
"Great shirts, nice fit!"
"Poor quality, pilled after washing, don't bother."
Comfy and fit well.
My new favorite ??
Great shirts.
